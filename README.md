#SnowDayiOS

iOS application that predicts the chance of a snow day for Grand Blanc Community Schools.

This program reads from [ABC 12's school closings](http://abc12.com/closings)
and the [National Weather Service](https://alerts.weather.gov/cap/wwaatmget.php?x=MIZ061&y=0).

This project was started in August 2016 and is currently a work in progress.
The original Java version is being developed at [CR96/SnowDay](https://github.com/cr96/snowday).
